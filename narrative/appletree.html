                <p>Old Apple Tree</p>

                <p>In 1826, a London dinner party guest playfully slipped apple seeds into Lieutenant Emilius Simpson's
                    waistcoat pocket, asking him to plant them across the world.</p>

                <p>He discovered them months later at Fort Vancouver and, with Dr. McLoughlin, planted Washington's
                    first apple tree. Around 1830, it produced one apple.</p>

                <p>Nearly 200 years later, it still bears fruit annually, having survived floods, storms, and progress
                    with roots that refuse to die.</p>

                <p>The old Apple tree born from humble seeds, became the matriarch of the entire Pacific Northwest apple
                    industry. In 1826, a London dinner party guest playfully slipped apple seeds into Lieutenant Emilius
                    Simpson's waistcoat pocket, asking him to plant them across the world.</p>
                <p>He discovered them months later at Fort Vancouver and, with Dr. McLoughlin, planted Washington's
                    first apple tree.</p>
                <p>Around 1830, it produced one apple. Nearly 200 years later, it still bears fruit annually, having
                    survived floods, storms, and progress with roots that refuse to die.</p>
